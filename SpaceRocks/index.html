            My game "Space Invaders" is just my rendition of the classic arcade game "Asteroids". I made it using the Game Maker Studio 2 IDE using only
            aspects and sprites that I made myself. I am no artist and I've always enjoyed playing games so I figured i'd give it a shot myself and develop
            a pretty basic one. There are tutorials on Game Maker Studio's site that helped walk me through this process. In regards to web development it 
            was interesting to tinker with my AWS server to get it to run on there. Thankfully the IDE I used has an HTML5 build extension. I hope you enjoy 
            playing my game. If it doesn't work at first try and reloading it. I unfortunately couldn't figure out how to make it take up the whole web page so 
            its stuck at the small margin within the whole page once you play it. Hopefully for the rest of my creative projects I can either add on to the 
            game or maybe find a way to make it multiplayer. Let me know if those are viable options for future creative projects! Click on "Play the Game" 
            on the menu bar to actually play the game.
